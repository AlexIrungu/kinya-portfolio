          THE RIPPLE EFFECT: IMPACT OF A DEVALUED CURRENCY ON SMALL BUSINESSES
        </h1>
                <p> Kenya, a vibrant hub of economic activity in East Africa, has long been home to a diverse array
of small businesses that form the backbone of its economy. In recent times however, the
country has grappled with the challenges posed by a devalued currency. The devaluation of the
Kenyan Shilling (KES) has set in motion a series of consequences that are keenly felt by small
businesses across the nation, affecting their operations, profitability, and long-term
sustainability. In this article, we delve into the intricacies of how the devalued Kenyan currency
is impacting small businesses and explore potential strategies for navigating these economic
headwinds. </p>

<ul className="list-disc pl-6">
  <li className="mb-8">
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">What is Currency Devaluation?</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700">
      Currency devaluation occurs when a country's currency loses value in comparison to other currencies. In Kenya, this phenomenon has been attributed to various factors, including inflation, trade imbalances, and global economic conditions. While a moderate level of devaluation can be a natural part of economic adjustments, an excessive and sustained decline in the value of the currency can have profound implications for businesses, especially smaller enterprises. Small businesses and the 'common Mwananchi' seem to be bearing the burden more than others, and here is how.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li className="mb-8">
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The Cost of Imported Goods and Services</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700">
      One of the immediate and direct consequences is the increased cost of imported goods and services. Kenya relies heavily on imports for various commodities, including raw materials and finished products. Small businesses, often operating on tight profit margins, find themselves grappling with higher procurement costs, a burden that is inevitably passed on to the consumers. Consider a local bakery sourcing wheat flour from abroad. As the Kenyan Shilling weakens, the cost of importing the flour rises, compelling the bakery to adjust its prices. For small businesses, this can lead to decreased competitiveness in the market and reduced purchasing power for their customer base.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li className="mb-8">
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Impact on Operational Costs</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700">
      Beyond the cost of imports, the devaluation of the Kenyan currency also impacts the operational costs of small businesses. Businesses that rely on machinery and equipment imported from other countries face increased maintenance and replacement costs. The depreciation of the currency further exacerbates the challenge, making it difficult for small enterprises to keep pace with technological advancements or maintain their existing infrastructure. Transportation costs, another critical component of operational expenses, are also affected. Fuel prices often rise in response to a devalued currency, affecting businesses involved in logistics, distribution, and transportation. Small businesses engaged in local and cross-border trade find themselves contending with a complex web of increased expenses, which, if left unaddressed, can erode profitability.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li className="mb-8">
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Challenges in Access to Credit</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700">
      Small businesses in Kenya often rely on loans and credit facilities to fund their operations and expansion plans. However, a devalued currency can complicate this aspect of business management. Financial institutions may become more cautious in extending credit, fearing increased risks associated with currency fluctuations. The higher costs of imports and operational expenses may strain the financial health of small businesses, making it challenging for them to meet their debt obligations. This situation can lead to a cycle where businesses struggle to access the necessary funds for growth and innovation, hindering their ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li className="mb-8">
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Effects on Consumer Behavior</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700">
      As small businesses grapple with rising costs, consumers are forced to reconsider their spending habits. The higher prices of goods and services may lead to a decline in consumer demand, particularly for non-essential items. Small businesses operating in discretionary spending sectors, such as retail and hospitality, find themselves navigating a challenging landscape where attracting and retaining customers becomes a formidable task. Additionally, as consumers tighten their belts in response to economic uncertainties, small businesses may face cash flow challenges. The delayed payment cycles and increased instances of bad debts further compound the financial woes of these enterprises, potentially pushing some to the brink of closure.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">How can Small Businesses Navigate Currency Devaluation?</h2>
    <ol className="list-decimal pl-8">
      <li className="mb-2">
        Diversification of Revenue Streams: Small businesses can explore diversification strategies, including expanding product offerings or entering new markets, to reduce dependency on a specific segment that may be more vulnerable to currency fluctuations.
      </li>
      <li className="mb-2">
        Risk Management and Hedging: Businesses can employ risk management tools such as hedging to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations. This involves using financial instruments to offset potential losses from adverse exchange rate movements.
      </li>
      <li className="mb-2">
        Collaboration and Networking: Small businesses can benefit from collaboration and networking within their industries. Information-sharing and collective negotiations with suppliers or financial institutions can provide a collective advantage in navigating economic challenges.
      </li>
      <li className="mb-2">
        Focus on Local Sourcing: Where feasible, businesses can consider sourcing raw materials locally to reduce exposure to currency risks associated with imports. This approach not only supports local suppliers but also enhances the resilience of the business to external economic shocks.
      </li>
      <li className="mb-2">
        Technology Adoption: Embracing technology can enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs. Automation, online sales channels, and digital payment systems can streamline processes and open up new avenues for revenue generation.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p className="text-gray-700">
      The devaluation of the Kenyan currency poses significant challenges to small businesses, but it also presents an opportunity for resilience and innovation. By adopting proactive strategies, staying informed about economic trends, and fostering collaboration within their communities, small businesses can weather the storm and emerge stronger on the other side. Navigating a devalued currency requires a combination of strategic planning, financial acumen, and adaptability. As small businesses in Kenya confront these challenges, their ability to innovate, collaborate, and pivot will be instrumental in not only surviving but thriving in an ever-changing economic landscape. The resilience of these businesses is not just a testament to their adaptability but also to their crucial role in shaping the economic narrative of Kenya.

        OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE UK POST COVID AND POST BREXIT
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-6">
  Since the 90â€™s, most economies in Sub-Saharan Africa have seen some level of growth. This can be seen through reforms in macroeconomic management, improved business environment, and commodity price hikes, but this growth has not translated into productive jobs. For most Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa, the major challenge has been unemployed and underemployment of the youth.</p>

  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-6">
    The world recently came off a pandemic that took a toll on most economies, and significant events such as the Russian-Ukraine war, coupled with post-Brexit, continue to affect trade, money flow, and human movement. This flow of events is majorly affecting young people who are setting foundations in their careers, jobs, business, and means of livelihood. In a bid to have discussions about these emerging issues, the ALIVE Foundation, in one of their networking programs, invited key players in the Commonwealth, United Kingdom, and the private sector to offer up solutions as well as highlight opportunities for young people in the UK post-Brexit.</p>

    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-6">
        Patricia Scotland, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, particularly pointed out the impact of technology on the economy. During the pandemic, digital trade was the tool that maintained trade at a constant level, and the key drivers were women and young people. This, she said, is the opportune time for young people to gain skills in Machine Learning, Blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence. This is the only way young people can harness the investments and jobs that are emerging due to new technology.</p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-6">
            Ambassador Amina Mohamed, the patron of ALIVE Foundation, also pointed out that young people are adopting the new wave of remote jobs and working from home. She alluded to this as a great entry point for young people to gain employment remotely. One of the foundation's deliverables is to come up with a toolkit whose main aim will be to ensure that skills earned in Kenya are up to standard and can guarantee employment in international markets.</p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-6">
                The High Commissioner of Kenya to the UK, H.E. Manoah Esipisu, who was also in attendance, echoed her sentiments, saying that some certifications in Kenya are internationally recognized, and more effort should be put into increasing the chances of our people to work abroad. An example would be Utalii College and Bandari College, whose certifications can secure you a job internationally. He went ahead to inform of job opportunities in the United Kingdomâ€™s agricultural sector under the seasonal labor workers scheme, which has now been made possible for Kenyans.</p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-6">
                    On matters of scholarship, Deputy High Commissioner Leigh Stubberfield mentioned the importance of gaining skills, experience, and networks as a strategy to set yourself apart while applying. H.E. Manoah also sensitized on the importance of doing in-depth research and consultation. He challenged young people to earn skills to solve emerging issues and gave a great example of Kenyatta University, Masinde Muliro University, Kisii University, among others, having research centers for cancer. This, he said, is a great chance for people in the field to educate themselves to be of help in society.
