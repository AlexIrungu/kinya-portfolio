          <em>“Changing the African Narrative”</em> According to those who hear
          this statement, there are two interpretations. One, the Afro-pessimist
          narrative, which typically portrays the continent as a place of poverty
          and disease. And two, the Afro-optimist narrative that shows Africa as
          a place of creativity, agency, and pride.

          Well, much as we hate to admit, some of the pessimistic remarks about
          Africa are true. Take Kenya for example, a great country, but at the
          mercy of corrupt leaders. Take Congo, such a rich and resource-filled
          country, but at war. Take Zimbabwe, grappling with hyperinflation, take
          South Africa and xenophobia. The list goes on and on.

          It is also a continent of 54 countries, none looking like the other. Our
          diversity has to be the greatest asset we own. The languages, the
          music, the food, the colors, the traditions are simply divine. Kenya
          with its landscape and wildlife, Congo with its resources, South Africa
          with its music, Nigeria with its vibrant music. The list goes on and on.

          As a Journalist and a storyteller, I have made it my goal to tell the
          stories in Africa. I’m not here to offer a quick fix, no one can.
          Instead of categorizing our stories as negative or positive, how about
          I just tell the truth about Africa?

          Welcome to Africa through my lens, my voice, and my perspective.
