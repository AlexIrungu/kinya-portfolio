                “Changing the African Narrative” According to those who hear this statement,there’s two
interpretations, one , the Afro-pessimist narrative.Which typically portrays the continent as a
place of poverty and disease and two, the Afro-optimist narrative that shows Africa as a place of
creativity, agency, and pride.
Well,much as we hate to admit,some of the pessimistic remarks about Africa are true. Take
Kenya for example,a great country, but at the mercy of corrupt leaders.Take Congo,such a rich
and resource-filled country,but at war. Take Zimbabwe,grappling with hyperinflation, take South
Africa and xenophobia.The list goes on and on.
But, a great BUT
It is also a continent of 54 countries,none looking like the other.Our diversity has to be the
greatest assets we own.The languages,the music,the food,the colors,the traditions are simply
divine.Kenya with its landscape and wildlife,Congo with its resources,South Africa with it
music,Nigeria with its vibrant music.The list goes on and on.
As a Journalist and a storyteller,I have made it my goal to tell the stories in Africa. I’m not here
to offer a quick fix,no one can. Instead of categorizing our stories as negative or positive,how
about I just tell the truth about Africa?
Welcome to Africa through my lens,my voice and my perspective.
